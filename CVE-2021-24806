SUMMARY
The plugin does check for CSRF when adding, editing and deleting comments, which could allow attacker to make logged in users such as admin edit and delete arbitrary comment, or the user who made the comment to edit it via a CSRF attack. Attackers could also make logged in users post arbitrary comment.

Other affected actions: wpdCloseThread (to close/open threads), wpdStickComment (to stick/unstick a comment)
